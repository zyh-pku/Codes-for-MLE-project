BOU_MIMLE_stationary_Gaussian_covariance_matrix
BOU_MIMLE_Fisher_information_diagonal_block.m documents the closed-form formula of the diagonal entries of the Fisher information matrix for the marginal-information maximum likelihood estimator(MLE) under the BOU model.
BOU_MIMLE_Fisher_information_off-diagonal_block.m documents the closed-form formula of the off-diagonal entries of the Fisher information matrix for the marginal-information MLE under the BOU model.

Fisher_BOU_MIMLE.m is the closed-form formula of the Fisher information matrix for the marginal-information maximum likelihood estimator(MLE) under the Bivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (BOU) model.
